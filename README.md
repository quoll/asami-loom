# asami-loom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/threatgrid/asami-loom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/threatgrid/asami-loom)

This library extends Asami in-memory graphs to Loom.

By requiring `asami-loom.index`, then the `asami.index.IndexGraph` graphs are extended to:
- `loom.graph.Graph`
- `loom.graph.EditableGraph`
- `loom.graph.DiGraph`

By requiring `asami-loom.multi-graph`, then the `asami.multi-graph.MultiGraph` graphs are extended to:
- `loom.graph.Graph`
- `loom.graph.EditableGraph`
- `loom.graph.DiGraph`
- `loom.graph.WeightedGraph`

By requiring `asami-loom.label`, then both the `asami.index.IndexGraph` and `asami.multi-graph.MultiGraph`
graphs get extended to:
- `loom.label.LabeledGraph`

## Usage

Requiring one of the above namespaces in any namespace that uses Asami in-memory graphs will automatically
apply the extensions. Loom can use the graphs with the standard APIs.

## Example

Configuring Asami Loom can be done by requiring the appropriate name spaces. Then just load data into Asami as usual.

Note: Some of this API will change soon to simplify. Specifically, the use of the Naga Storage API will be dropped.
This means that `naga.store` won't be needed, as the graph won't need to be extracted from the store object.

```clojure
(require '[asami.core :refer [empty-store q]])
(require '[naga.store :refer [new-node assert-data]])

(defn nn [] (new-node empty-store))

(def data
 (let [pmc (nn)
       gh (nn)
       jl (nn)
       r1 (nn)
       r2 (nn)
       r3 (nn)
       r4 (nn)
       r5 (nn)]
   [[pmc :artist/name "Paul McCartney"]
    [gh :artist/name "George Harrison"]
    [jl :artist/name "John Lennon"]
    [r1 :release/artists pmc]
    [r1 :release/name "My Sweet Lord"]
    [r2 :release/artists gh]
    [r2 :release/name "Electronic Sound"]
    [r3 :release/artists gh]
    [r3 :release/name "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"]
    [r4 :release/artists gh]
    [r4 :release/name "All Things Must Pass"]
    [r5 :release/artists jl]
    [r5 :release/name "Imagine"]]))

(def graph (:graph (assert-data empty-store)))
```

The entity IDs created with `nn` above are represented as keywords with the namespace "mem".
Also, edges are typically keywords, but can also be strings.
With these assumptions in mind, we can use the following definitions to get labels for edges or nodes.

```clojure
(defn edge-label
  [g s d]
  (let [edge (ffirst (concat (resolve-triple g s '?e d)
                             (resolve-triple g d '?e s)))]
    (cond (string? edge) edge
          (keyword? edge) (name edge)
          :default (str edge))))

(defn node-label
  [g n]
  (let [id (ffirst (resolve-triple g n :id '?id))]
    (cond id (str id)
          (and (keyword? n) (= (namespace n) "mem")) (str ":" (name n))
          :default (str n))))
```

With this configuration set up, the Loom `display` function can be used to create a graphical view.

```clojure
(require '[asami-loom.index])
(require '[asami-loom.label])
(require '[loom.io :as loom-io])

(loom-io/view graph :fmt :pdf :alg :sfdp :edge-label edge-label :node-label node-label)
```

## View Parameters

Valid algorithms are:
- :dot
- :neato
- :fdp
- :sfdp
- :twopi
- :circo

Valid Formats are:
- :png
- :ps
- :pdf
- :svg

Loom launches the system default viewers for these file types.
