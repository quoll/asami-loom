# asami-loom

This library extends Asami in-memory graphs to Loom.

By requiring `asami-loom.index`, then the `asami.index.IndexGraph` graphs are extended to:
- `loom.graph.Graph`
- `loom.graph.EditableGraph`
- `loom.graph.DiGraph`

By requiring `asami-loom.multi-graph`, then the `asami.multi-graph.MultiGraph` graphs are extended to:
- `loom.graph.Graph`
- `loom.graph.EditableGraph`
- `loom.graph.DiGraph`
- `loom.graph.WeightedGraph`

By requiring `asami-loom.label`, then both the `asami.index.IndexGraph` and `asami.multi-graph.MultiGraph`
graphs get extended to:
- `loom.label.LabeledGraph`

## Usage

Requiring one of the above namespaces in any namespace that uses Asami in-memory graphs will automatically
apply the extensions. Loom can use the graphs with the standard APIs.
